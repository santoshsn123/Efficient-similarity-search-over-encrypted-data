Two new items the client has reported:

1.      The image from Instagram is not displaying on the home page.  It has been showing blank all day  No reports our API outage from Instagram that I have found.

Hello Sean,

"The image from Instagram is not displaying on the home page. It has been showing blank all day No reports our API outage from Instagram that I have found."

Hello ,

We want to use your app WellnessLiving App.

We are having some questions before we start using it, it will be great if anyone from you can answer them.

1) Where our customers will be able to see the app that is going to show our services or products? I mean you will provide APK file or you upload it to playstores ?

2) Is that possible to make changes in it, or can we add some extra features in the app.

3) When we will be making changes in admin panel for application, we will have to download new apk or the installed app automatically shows the changes?
