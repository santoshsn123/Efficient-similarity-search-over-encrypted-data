                <h2>About Project</h2>
                In recent years, due to the appealing features of cloud computing, large amount of data have been stored in the cloud. Although
                cloud based services offer many advantages, privacy and security of the sensitive data is a big concern.
                To mitigate the concerns, it is desirable to outsource sensitive data in encrypted form. Encrypted storage
                protects the data against illegal access, but it complicates some basic, yet important functionality such
                as the search on the data. To achieve search over encrypted data without compromising the privacy, considerable
                amount of searchable encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, almost all of them
                handle exact query matching but not similarity matching, a crucial requirement for real world applications.
                Although some sophisticated secure multi-party computation based cryptographic techniques are available for
                similarity tests, they are computationally intensive and do not scale for large data sources. In this paper,
                we propose an efficient scheme for similarity search over encrypted data. To do so, we utilize a state-of-the-art
                algorithm for fast near neighbor search in high dimensional spaces called locality sensitive hashing.
